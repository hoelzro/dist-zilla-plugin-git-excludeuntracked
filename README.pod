Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::ExcludeUntracked - Excludes untracked files from your dist

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [Git::ExcludeUntracked]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Dist::Zilla> plugin automatically excludes any files from your
distribution that are not currently tracked by Git.

=head1 COMPARED TO GIT::GATHERDIR

There's another plugin that provides similar functionality:
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::GatherDir>.  The chief difference is that
while this plugin is designed to work in concert with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir>, C<Git::GatherDir> is designed to work
as a replacement for C<GatherDir>.
